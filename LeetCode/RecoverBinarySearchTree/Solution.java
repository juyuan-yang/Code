/*
 * Recover Binary Search Tree - Sep 1 '12 - 4967 / 16821

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. 
Could you devise a constant space solution?
confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
